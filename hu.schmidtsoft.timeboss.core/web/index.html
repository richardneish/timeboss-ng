<h1>Timeboss project page</h1>
<p>Timeboss is standalone desktop application that always asks you what and how long will you be doing. When the time is spent it asks again. All activity is logged to xml files so you will have genuine timesheet of your time facing your computer. There is an exporter that exports your activity to CSV table.</p>
<p>Timeboss is written in Java and should work on all platforms that are supported by Java 6.</p>
<p>Timeboss is free software hosted on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/timeboss/">Sourceforge</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=248639">download</a> and use Timeboss in less then five minutes!</p>
<h2>Timeboss is sitting on your system tray</h2>
<p><strong>Timeboss always wants to know what you are doing.</strong></p>

<p>Timeboss chages its color to show three states:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Timeboss knows that you are working on. Fine! <img src="icon-work.png"/></li>
	<li>Timeboss knows that you are on rest. You are not as perfect as Timeboss. You need rest to survive. Semi-fine! <img src="icon-rest.png"/></li>
	<li>Timeboss has no clue what you are doing. Don't let that last long! <img src="icon-what.png"/></li>
</ul>
<h2>The form to fill</h2>
